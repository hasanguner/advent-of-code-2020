# Advent of Code 2020 :christmas_tree:

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and
skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. I picked Java for this year's challenge.

## How to run?

```bash
$ make run day=20
```
